# 🌌 ArXiv Paper Embedding Visualizer (APEV)

## 🚀 Project Goal

The primary objective of the ArXiv Paper Embedding Visualizer (APEV) is to provide an interactive and intuitive way to explore the relationships between research papers.

This application visualizes research paper embeddings from ArXiv as a 3D interactive space where each paper is represented as a clickable point. Users can freely navigate through the embedding space, click on a point to view a paper's detailed information, and eventually filter or color the data based on rich metadata (such as topics, authors, and publication dates).

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The project is divided into two distinct components: the backend data pipeline and the frontend visualization application.

| *Component*    | *Technology* | *Role* |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------ |
| Backend (Data Pipelines)  | Kedro, Python, Arxiv, Numpy, Umap, SciKit-Learn, HuggingFace   | Downloads papers, generates paper embeddings, creates rich metadata dataframes, and processes the final visualization-ready JSON file.| 
Frontend (Visualization App) | React, TypeScript, Three.js/R3F | Loads the generated JSON data, renders the interactive 3D space, and handles user interactions (navigation, hover, click). |

  


⚙️ Data Structure (Frontend Input)

The frontend expects a single JSON file generated by the backend pipeline. This structure ensures that coordinate data and detailed metadata can be efficiently mapped and accessed by the 3D visualization layer.
```json
{
  "coordinates": [
    {"id": "abc123", "x": 0.15, "y": 0.23, "z": -0.45},
    {"id": "xyz789", "x": -0.88, "y": 0.51, "z": 0.12},
    ...
  ],
  "details": {
    "abc123": {"title": "Attention Is All You Need", "authors": "Vaswani et al.", "topic": "CS.CL"},
    "xyz789": {"title": "Deep Learning", "authors": "Goodfellow et al.", "topic": "CS.LG"},
    ...
  },
  "metadata": {
    /* Global metadata, e.g., list of authors, categories, comment, title, summary, etc... */
  }
}
```

Key Requirement: The application must load this JSON file at startup, create a 3D point for each entry in coordinates, and use the id field to map the point back to its corresponding details in the details object for interaction handling.
